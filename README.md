This is a proof-of-concept of integrating Google Assistant voice service with Asterisk on a Raspberry Pi. You should not connect this to a publicly accessible inbound telephone number without reading and agreeing to Google Assistant SDK Terms of Service. (Requires approval and possible fees)  But can be used for personal use only.

Note that although this works on a Raspi Zero W, it runs much faster on a Raspberry Pi 3. 


### GOOGLE ASSISTANT SDK 
Requires a Google Cloud Account (free)
